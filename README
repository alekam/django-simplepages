django-simplepages
==================

This project is forked from its original host in
[googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/django-simplepages/). For the original
documentation, please refer to its wiki page.

Differences
===========

1. The SIMPLEPAGES_HTML_EDITOR settings configuration is removed, as well as
   the embedding of YUI JS code in the admin interface to edit HTML pages.
   A more pluggable and/or embeddable solution is desired.

To Do
=====

1. Add support for pluggable markup engine to edit HTML pages.
   Possibly with JS to preview as you go.
